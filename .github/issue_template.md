### IMPORTANT
Use issues to keep track of ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. NEVER as a support forum. If you have questions, please ask them first in the mailing list john-users at lists.openwall.com.

### Steps to reproduce
Try to be clear about your environment and what you are doing. If possible, share with us the file or hash you are auditing.

### System configuration
Attach details about your OS and about JtR, including:
- are you using bleeding-jumbo? Updated?
- `$ john --list=build-info`.
- `$ john --list=opencl-devices` (if applicable).
