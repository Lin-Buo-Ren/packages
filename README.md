Packages
=============

There are **Snap** and **Flatpak** packages here. My Ubuntu Snap packages are:

- [anatine](https://github.com/sindresorhus/anatine) for more details.
- [John the Ripper](https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper) for more details.
- [namebench](https://code.google.com/archive/p/namebench) for more details.
- [corebird](https://github.com/baedert/corebird) for more details (*not published*; works only on --devmode).
- [doctl](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl) for more details (*not published*).
- [polly](https://launchpad.net/polly) for more details (*not published*; upstream is dead).

Anyone can get, for free (as in beer and in freedom), the reviewed packages from https://uappexplorer.com. Despite the fact it is an unofficial repository, all packages are hosted and reviewed (automatically) by Ubuntu.

More information is available inside each project sub-folder (at least, some of them).
